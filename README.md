# RL and Meta-RL approaches for in-flight action calibration in the Continuous Lunar Lander environment.

Course project for Stanford CS 238: Decision Making Under Uncertainty.

In this project, we implemented and tested multiple RL and Meta-RL algorithms in a novel version of the Continuous Lunar Lander environment, in which agent actions are offset by an unknown amount, randomly chosen at the start of each episode. This environment setup models potential calibration issues in the engines or control systems for the lander.
